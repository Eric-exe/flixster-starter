### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, they did help me alot with completing the assignment. However, one thing I would've changed is when certain content is taught in. I feel that stuff like useState and useEffect should've been taught on the same day as components as that really solidified my understanding of React.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would like to have added a remove watched/favorited feature in the sidebar or maybe even miniature cards.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The main thing that didn't go too well is understanding that react states don't update immediately. Some of my earlier code depended on the variables immediately updating and that caused some issues when I started out.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

- Shoutout to Sammy for helping me with CSS.
- Shoutout to Carson for showing my flex-wrap instead of display: grid. This allowed me to make a collapsable sidebar.
